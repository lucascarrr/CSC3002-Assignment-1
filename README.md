***To Run***

- open terminal and cd into folder directory 
- run the 'server.py' file
- in another terminal, run the 'interface.py' file. 
   - this will create a process which connects to the server and acts as a 'user'. 
   - to add multiple users, you will require multiple terminals. 

***To Do***
- User confirmation message - only set logged_in to true when message is received. 
   - Include in this: checking database to see if username exists
- Handshake (not sure what to do)
- Message Delivery confirmation. - could do, when the server forwards a message to the client, it sends a message of certain type to the sender (message could just be hash of original message, or something similar. 
- Login Page (not essential)
- Message sounds DONE
- if user does not exist in DM, error message, not! broadcast
